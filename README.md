## Technology Stack

- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
- Users
- Properties
- Bookings
- Reviews
- Payments.

## Feature Breakdown
- API Documentation

  OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
  Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
  GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

- User Authentication

  Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

- Property Management

  Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

- Booking System

  Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

- Payment Processing

  Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

- Review System

  Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

- Database Optimizations

    Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
    Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

The following security measures are implemented to protect data, services, and users:

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**:  
  We use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to ensure only verified users can access protected endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access and data breaches.

- **Authorization**:  
  Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts what authenticated users can do based on their assigned roles (e.g., admin, user). This helps ensure users can only perform actions they are permitted to.

- **Rate Limiting**:  
  To prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, we apply rate limiting using tools like API gateways or middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit` for Node.js).

- **Data Encryption**:  
  All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS) to prevent interception and tampering.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**:  
  We validate all user inputs to protect against injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

### Why Security Matters

- **Protecting User Data**:  
  User credentials, personal information, and session data must be safeguarded to comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and prevent identity theft.

- **Securing Payments and Transactions**:  
  For applications handling financial data or payments, encryption and secure authentication ensure transaction integrity and prevent fraud.

- **Maintaining Service Availability**:  
  Rate limiting and traffic control prevent abuse and ensure the API remains responsive and available for all users.

- **Ensuring Trust and Compliance**:  
  A secure API builds user trust and helps meet compliance standards critical in regulated industries like healthcare and finance.

## CI/CD Pipelines

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that updates are delivered quickly, safely, and consistently.

### Importance for the Project

- **Automated Testing**: Ensures that code changes do not break existing features.
- **Faster Delivery**: Speeds up development cycles and feature releases.
- **Consistency**: Reduces human error and ensures that deployments follow the same process every time.
- **Rollback Support**: Makes it easier to revert to a previous state if something goes wrong.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Terraform / Kubernetes (optional)**: For managing cloud infrastructure and scalable deployment (depending on project scope).
